## Research Profile

I work at the intersection of **Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Multi-Agent Systems**, with a focus on developing **robust, reproducible, and deployable AI solutions** for real-world applications.

My research spans **medical image analysis**, **clinical decision-support systems**, and **multi-agent reinforcement learning for autonomous systems**, combining **deep learning**, **probabilistic reasoning**, and **system-level engineering**. I am particularly interested in translating research ideas into **production-ready pipelines** through principled experimentation and rigorous evaluation.

Current research interests include:
- **Medical image segmentation and quantitative analysis**
- **LLM-augmented decision-support systems (RAG, tool-augmented reasoning)**
- **Collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning**
- **Edge-deployed AI and embedded intelligent systems**
